# Vim Venders!

A Vim config inspired by the work of Wim Wenders.

## Quick Setup

Thereâ€™s a setup script included that will create a bunch of directories in
`~/.vim`, symlink `~/.vimrc` and `~/.gvimrc` to `~/.vim/vimrc` and
`~/.vim/gvimrc` respectively, and install a bunch of plugins. Checkout and
setup like so:

    git clone https://github.com/roshambo/vim-venders.git ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    ./setup
